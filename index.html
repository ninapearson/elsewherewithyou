The poor road soon turned to a dirt hill and the small amount of profile that was left on the wheels of our rental bike didn’t hold out.

We lost some time replacing the tyre which meant we didn’t reach our ‘planned’ destination on the first night – a forest looking area on the french side of the border between Switzerland and France, instead we found a pizza restaurant and a different forest, still in Switzerland to pitch our tent. It was the most serene camping spot, we slept well. The rest of the journey was somewhat smoother and after another 80 km of bike riding we arrived at our airbnb. We were greeted with locally brewed beers and enjoyed a balmy evening on the terrace of our renovated barn house from 1699. There there was a certain je ne sais quoi in the chaos of this trip, the challenge of riding the whole way to Alsace attracted our attention, the bike trail dotted with blooming spring flowers flattered our imaginations, and the house perched amongst the vineyards gained upon our hearts.
